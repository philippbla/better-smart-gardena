# real-smart-gardena

Since I was not satisfied with the smart system from Gardena for my automatic irrigation system, I built my own backend to implement crucial functions I was missing from the App.
I didn't have the time to write a proper documentation about my project, if there is interest in my code, please reach out to me and I can provide you with a documentation. Reach my via linkedin philipp-blattner

Disclaimer: this repo still has a few bugs but it's a more or less working prototype of my ideas on how to improve the gardena system
